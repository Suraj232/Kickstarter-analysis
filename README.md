# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data 
# 1. Overview
The data provide for this project was over 4000 rows and 13 columns. This assignment uses some of the tools like Pivot table, pivot chart, countifs (), and line chart to name a few key functions to show the filter the data and present it in the form of a chart. 
# 2. Purpose of the Analysis
The main purpose of this assignment was to analyze data with two different requirements which are mentioned below:
-	Outcome based on Launch date
-	Outcome based on Goal chart
-	Written Analysis of the result
#	3. Deliverables and challenges Faced: 
### 3.1 First deliverable

The first phase of the challenge was resolved by using pivot table function and filtering out the required sections and arranging the data in a readable and presentable format. After the final table was created, a pivot chart was created using the information. The image of chart is given below.

### 3.2 Second deliverable

In second phase the outcome was analyzed with respect to the goals. This task was done with the help of a function called countifs (). Once the data was collected, a line graph was plotted. The image of the graph is shown below.

### 3.3 Challenges faced
One of the challenges that I faced was while using countifs () function. Initially the data I filtered after using countifs () had lot of errors because I used wrong signs while mentioning conditions. But eventually I found my mistake and rectified it. 

# 4. Result
#### 4.1	 What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
Success rate is higher when theater is launched at the month of May.

Failure rate is higher when theater is launched at the month of December.
#### 4.2  What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The success percentage is higher for the goal under or equal to $1,000 followed by range $1,000 to $4,999
#### 4.3  What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations of this dataset is that we couldn’t find the potential outliers.
#### 4.4	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
To further analyze the data, we could have created a table with information’s like mean, median, mode, standard deviation and quartiles. With this information we can plot a box and whisker graph to find the potential outliers if any.
